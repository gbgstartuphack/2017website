      <h1>Practical Info</h1>

      <p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is about <strong>building and demoing a product prototype</strong>.

      <p>We prefer <strong>fresh ideas</strong> and <strong>technological innovation</strong> over a solid business case. Don't worry about the numbers or the bottom line — use your imagination, think outside the box and go nuts!

      <p><strong>This hack is about building stuff</strong> — a demo with just a PowerPoint presentation ain't gonna fly.

      <p>We're hosting a <b this-should-be-a-link-later>meetup in april</b> — where we'll all hang out and meet each other. Looking for a team or more team members? This is the right place to be!

      <!--p>Once you have put together a versatile team, make sure to sign up before the application deadline — <strong><time datetime="2016-05-2">May 2</time></strong-->.

      <p>We think that the best teams are made up of people with <strong>different skills</strong> and <strong>different backgrounds</strong>.

      <p>We recommend team sizes <strong>between 3 to 5 people</strong>.

      <p>Finally, the hack takes place on <strong>May 14</strong>. Be prepared to hack from early in the morning 'til late in the evening.

      <p>We will keep you comfortable and make sure you are fed all the way through.</p>

        <p>You and your crew have exactly one day to turn your product idea into a working prototype. <strong>Use your time wisely</strong> — at the end of the day you will take the stage to demo what you have built.</p>
        <p>The day starts when you board <strong>the ship</strong>. We will show you to your station and help you get set up — the goal is to get up and running with <strong>the hacking</strong>.</p>
        <p>Lunch buffet will be served enroute — a good opportunity to meet with other hackers and <strong>share ideas</strong>. Later, back at the docks dinner buffet will be served and we will keep hacking until sunset — this is when we start the demos.</p>
        <p>Be sure to pay attention and remember your favorite teams — the winners will be decided through majority vote. After that we take shore leave and head over to <stong> the open track</stong>, where the winners are announced and get to pitch for real. Now get to it - <strong>Go make something real</strong>!</p>

      <div class="questions-container">
        <div>
          <h3>How do I keep up to date with information?</h3>
          <p>Regularly check out this site, <a href="#subscribe-btn">subscribe to our newsletter</a> and stay up to date by keeping an eye on our <a href="http://twitter.com/gbgstartuphack">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gbgstartuphack">facebook</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can I sign up alone?</h3>
          <p>Sadly not. But why not bring your idea and find your team at <a href="#">the Meetup</a>?</p> <!-- You can also let us match you <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17axlk7bDfYMOfK-FD9t-NWf-pkLHTW0HryGBrXLY3rY/viewform">right here</a>. Or you can head over to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1399972033646075/">matchup space</a> and see if you can find people to team up with yourself.</p-->
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>How large can our team be?</h3>
          <p>At most 5 people, and you should be at least 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Where do I find team members?</h3>
          <p>IRL, at the internet, or at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1553463541601380/">the Meetup</a>. Try using our hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gbgstartuphack&src=typd">#gbgstartuphack</a> when looking for prospective team members! You can also check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1399972033646075/">matchup space</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17axlk7bDfYMOfK-FD9t-NWf-pkLHTW0HryGBrXLY3rY/viewform">let us match you</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Do I get favored in the selection process if I sign up early?</h3>
          <p>Nope</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>My idea and/or team has somehow changed since we entered our signup information, what do I do?</h3>
          <p>Mail us at <a href="mailto:info@gbgstartuphack.com">info@gbgstartuphack.com</a> and we’ll get back to you!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Can we start hacking on our idea before the hack?</h3>
          <p>Please use common sense; do not bring your startup’s finished product/prototype. Use this day to hack on the things you do not normally get time for.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>There’s no Facebook event for The Hack? Where and how do I sign up?</h3>
          <p><a href="#sign-up">Here.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Does the idea/prototype have to be strictly based on IT?</h3>
          <p>This is a hackathon, so it should include hacking code in one way or the other. If you’re unsure if your idea fits the format, just <a href="mailto:info@gbgstartuphack.com">drop us an email.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Do I need to be able to code in order to apply?</h3>
          <p>Oh no! It's all about building a team which eventually will deliver something cool during the day.
          Feel free to be the planning person in your group.</p>
          <h4>A sample team</h4>
          <p>A neat team compilation of four people consist of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Two developers</li>
            <li>One designer</li>
            <li>One <em>planning person</em> overseeing the progress, creating the presentation, engineering the
            overall vision, and more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or, why separate the roles?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Three developers knowing design, or three designers who can code</li>
            <li>One <em>planning person</em></li>
          </ul>
