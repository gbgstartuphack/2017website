      <h1>Practical Info</h1>

      <p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is about <strong>building and demoing a product prototype</strong>.

      <p>We prefer <strong>fresh ideas</strong> and <strong>technological innovation</strong> over a solid business case. Don't worry about the numbers or the bottom line — use your imagination, think outside the box and go nuts!

      <p><strong>This hack is about building stuff</strong> — a demo with just a PowerPoint presentation ain't gonna fly.

      <p>We will be hosting a <strong>meetup (date TBA)</strong> — where we'll all hang out and meet each other. Looking for a team or more team members? This is the right place to be!

      <p>Once you have put together a versatile team, make sure to sign up before the application deadline — <strong><time datetime="2016-05-2">TBA</time></strong>.

      <p>We think that the best teams are made up of people with <strong>different skills</strong> and <strong>different backgrounds</strong>.

      <p>We recommend team sizes <strong>between 3 to 5 people</strong>.

      <p>Finally, the hack takes place on <strong>May 14</strong>. Be prepared to hack from early in the morning 'til late in the evening.

      <p>We will keep you comfortable and make sure you are fed all the way through.</p>

            <p>Market surveys are an important part of many companies business models but it its current form it can be extremely exhausting and unrewarding for subjects. We are now changing that!</p>
            <p>Enter Surview. Through text messaging based surveys, we are making surveys a more joyful experience for both customers and companies. Instead of having to answer a whole bunch of boring questions in a web form, you are simply, from the customers view, having a conversation with another person. We believe the right way to bring this idea to life is through founding a startup. There is definitely more work to be done on the subject of analyzing the data we recieve through our surveys. We are convinced there is a market out there for our more relaxed and conversational looking surveys.</p>

            <p>Imagine working at your desk, in front of you a coffee cup and sky-facing smartphone lying flat on your desk. Next to it, a chic cube device lights up letting you know the next tram to the home leaves in 3 minutes. Do you quickly pack and leave the office or carry on uninterrupted till the next tram?</p>
            <p>
The gadget is a low cost device. The display is unusual, a lo-fi LED screen displays data in a highly abstracted way as lights using patterns or numbers giving it a retro 70’s feel. It should be fun to use and a stylish desk accessory. The device is controlled by apps installed online which connects via wifi. The user can use apps to customize information to be displayed on the device. Online a user can interact with the app on a familiar level and so intuitively understand the abstracted data displaying on the desk. An app could be set up to show tram times leaving a selected stop, tasks left via google, messages and so on. App development should be opensource so any user could build and share useful abstractions. The device’s only interaction is a touch sensitive area to cycle through apps. The device is also modular and can be joined together to several devices changing its shape to create a larger screen or cube which adds fun and increased functionality.

            <p>The idea is basically an app allowing ordinary Joes and Jones to help each other out with various everyday tasks. You post something you want help with, your location and what you’re willing to pay. Everyone who’s registered as a helper can now see your post on both a map based on location and in a sorted list inside the app and check it out. If they’ve got the skills they can contact you and help you out. Simple as that! Since everyone is good at something, this makes it easy for people wanting to earn a bit of extra cash at the same time as helping someone out. It could be as easy as building an IKEA-shelf for someone, or installing a new router for an old couple. Über is a great example of how how ordinary people can help each other out when in need.</p>
